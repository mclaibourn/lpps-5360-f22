We'll share our work on the course webpage as a way of contributing to the emerging efforts at promoting equity through policy.

## The Meaning of Equity

In this first project, we explored what “equity” means to the federal government by coding the content of the recently released Equity Action Plans submitted by federal agencies. Based on our reading and discussion, we created a simple coding scheme to capture potential dimensions of equity. Working in teams, we coded 19 of the 23 agency plans.

* [Quantitative summary of equity action plan coding](../materials/equity_action_plans/)

Each team provided additional narrative interpretation describing how equity was being used in their focal agencies, how this differed across agencies, and what implications this has for how target populations are understood or the potential for equitable change.
